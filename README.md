## action-release-download

#### TODO (v1)

- extract zip function
- extract tar function
- query for the latest release of a github repo using the api
- get list of assets from a github repo using the api

#### Development sanity
```bash
npx npm-packlist # check what is included in the NPM package
yarn publish --dry-run # dry run publishing to NPM
```
