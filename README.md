## action-release-download

#### TODO (v1)

- write a little readme
- tests for parsing github versions

#### Done
- replace console log stuff with actions core
- publish on npm!
- check the input parameters if they are empty
- lint the code
- get list of assets from a github repo using the api
- query for the latest release of a github repo using the api

#### Development sanity
```bash
npx npm-packlist # check what is included in the NPM package
yarn publish --dry-run # dry run publishing to NPM
```
